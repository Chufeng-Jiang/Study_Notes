        We traverse the array,and each time we compare 3 consecutive elements, 
        because we have to consider that after the modification, whether the new array can satisfy 
        that â‘  the visited elements are non-decreasing and â‘¡the incoming elements are also non-decreasing. 

        Input = [3,4,2,5]:
                        5

             3 /  \\   /
                    \\2
        In this case, we can modify 4 or 2 to make a non-decreasing order.
        However, since the trough 2 is even smaller than the number of 3 which is 2 position in front of it: 
        (1) if we reduce 4 to 2, then [3,2,2,|...] doesn't satisfy our requirement, and need further modification.
        (1) if we increase 2 to 4, then [3,4,4,|...] satisfy our requirement.

        Input = [1,4,2,5]:

             1 /  
        In this case,  we only need to modify 4, because the trough of 2 is higher than the minimum 1 which is 2 position in front of it.
